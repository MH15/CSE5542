# CSE5542 Lab1
CSE 5543 Realtime Rendering at Ohio State 

https://github.com/MH15/CSE5542


## Notes

I developed this project in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) framework. I've taken the best effort to ensure the compiled Javascript code matches as closely as possible. To view the compiled version (pure HTML and Javascript), open a terminal in the `submit` directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
# if you have NodeJS installed,
npx serve

# if you have Python installed,
python server.py
```

## Running Dev Server

If you'd like to run the Typescript source code of the project, do the following commands in the `labs` directory.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Both versions should function identically in most browsers.**
